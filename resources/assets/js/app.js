 |
 | First, we will load all of the "core" dependencies for Spark which are
 | libraries such as Vue and jQuery. This also loads the Spark helpers
 | for things such as HTTP calls, forms, and form validation errors.
 |
 | Next, we will create the root Vue application for Spark. This'll start
 | the entire application and attach it to the DOM. Of course, you may
 | customize this script as you desire and load your own components.
